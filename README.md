## Todo

-   Set up proxy server - Due to cors error setting up a proxy to solve the
    problem. Solved via AWS cloudformation proxy

-   Fix UI - Dark theme ui currently chosen, still subject to change

-   Implement buttons - Implemented buttons with filtering actions via client
    side

-   Remove multiple month user selections - Multiple selections not intended for
    monthly filters, fixed with radio buttons instead

*   Genres, platforms, low due to low amount of fetched items - Currently
    fetching 500 items however trade off is slow initial page load

*   game sorting API - Solved using months and years and timestamps instead of
    server side sorting

*   Make button to see image .card.image-full:before backbground color to
    restore brightness, card-body opacity 0 - Currently pseudo class controls
    overlay which makes covers dark, havent figured out how to bypass this

*   Filtering - Currently on client side, switching to server side may improve
    load times

*   Sort games correctly - sorting implemented correctly however small issues
    due to API not having full dates for all games

*   Pagination

*   Screen sizes UI

## Future implementations

-   Reduce useState

*   Optimize web app

*   Make functions more general in context

*   Make buttons more general purpose - repeated code

-   Fetch can overload - Replace fetch api with react query

*   Clear all filters button - Not true clear all, ideally remove all checkbox
    to unchecked, reset to oroginal list without page refresh

# View Upcoming Games

Upcoming games web application is focused on providing accessible information on
upcoming games in a user-friendly interface with tools to provide multiple
filtering options.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.
